# Task Result

## Technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- React
- JavaScript

I chose React because it gives you the possibility to work on a modular basis by using components.
It is a JavaScript library that I enjoy working with, offers fast rendering throught it's Virtual DOM, has a very useful developer toolset and a really strong community support that is continuously growing.
The downside of using React from my point of view is that you have to use some/alot of external packages depending on the application that is being developed.

## Used 3rd Party Libraries

I use the following 3rd party libraries in my project:
| Name | Reason |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) | To fetch meme images from imgflip API. |
| [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) | Simple RWD framework for designing the front end. |
| [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) | For navigation. |
